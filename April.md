Cold ass sunday, Got some fries at MacDonald and called isacco. Found out that Albania doesnt have any data. So disappointed. Considering idea of taking it at national level. Standards would fit. Will write an email to learn more about municipalities data.

Tomorrow will write email to Instat e WUBib about ESRI.

Okay, after one hour i collected some data for MK and RS but have some problems with some data points which i do not think will be feasible get....
