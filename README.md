# Master Thesis: Determinants of Growth in EU28 + CANDID8

Welcome! The structure of this repository is the following:

- In `Pitch/` you can find the PDFs of my Topic Pitch and Update presentations;
- In `Project/` you can find the main body of research with code and data.
- `Setup.xlxs` is an Excel Table I used to monitor data coverage, notes and sources as I was collecting.

More in detail, `Project/` contains:
- `code/` where all R code is stored for the cleaning, visualisation and modelling of the data; 
- The original or intermediate data versions I worked with;
- `final-inputs/` containing the final original dataset, its imputed versions, and the corresponding spatial matrices I will employ in my analysis.

Should you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at h12039313@s.wu.ac.at :)
