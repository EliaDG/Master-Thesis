# Master Thesis: Determinants of Growth in EU27 + EXTRA9

Welcome! The structure of this repository is the following:

- In `Pitch/` you can find the PDFs of my Pitch and Update presentations;
- In `Project/` you can find the main body of research with code and data.
- `Setup.xlxs` which is an Excel Table I used to monitor data coverage, notes and sources as I was collecting.

More in detail, `Project/` contains:
- `code/` where all R code is stored for the cleaning, visualisation and modelling of the data; 
- The original or intermediate data versioning I worked with;
- `final-inputs/` containing the final original dataset, its imputed version, and the corresponding spatial matrices I will emply in my analysis.
